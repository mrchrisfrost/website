       Once again welcome. At this point I guess you're wondering a little about me, what makes me tick and why I'm applying to<br>
       the program, and also what makes me a good candidate. To answer those I guess it's best to start with why I chose those<br>
       the pictures I did. *** Bonus points if you can tell me the name of the attachment on my rifle.***<p>
           Well the first one, that was me not too long ago. Running around the mountains of Afghanistan doing things, that no one else<br>
           wants to do. Even rather I say, shouldn't have to do. But 'eh, it's a life and chose it. Facing challenges is something that has<br>
           deterred me from doing what I wanted to do, even when creating those challenges just to see if I could overcome them was<br>
           a self action. The picture next to it is another picture of strength, taken outside a hall at my mother's funeral. Even if times <br>
           of pure sadness I keep moving forward. Next we have VADER KLAUS, in crowds where everyone is the same, I find a way to <br>stand out.
           The eagle on my splash page symbolizes how I feel at right now I'm spreading my wings getting ready to take <br>that dive and capture
           my pray. The background here shows that I'm willing to get down and dirty to do it. <br> And lastly the contact page... <h2>The World is my Objective!</h2>
